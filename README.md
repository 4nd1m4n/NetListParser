# NetListParser
Student project from the HTW Dresden with the goal of implementing a parser in C++ that can read the *expanded netlists* from *LTSpices logfile* and can output the nodelist and more from it's own internal data representation.

**I have to work alone on this project until i finished my presentation in university. After that (roughly after 05/17) i will be allowed to have pull requests. Thanks.
